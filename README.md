## What Can I Craft?

This mod greatly simplifies the crafting process in Project Zomboid. By adding a "What Can I Craft?" option to the context menu when you right-click on any item, you can instantly access the crafting window with the recipes already filtered for the selected item.

Forget the complicated steps of opening the crafting window, typing in the item name, and selecting from the dropdown list. With "What Can I Craft?", just one click will show you all the available recipes for the chosen item, making crafting faster and more intuitive.

The mod is safe to add or remove from existing saves and should be compatible with all other mods.
